SOLVING QUADRATIC EQUATION


A quadratic equation is an equation of the second degree, meaning it contains at least one term that is squared.

The standard form is axÂ² + bx + c = 0 with a, b, and c being constants, or numerical coefficients,and x is an unknown variable. 
One absolute rule is that the first constant "a" cannot be a zero.
